I am a results oriented programmer with a wide range of software development skills including Full stack web development, blockchain and Dapp development, 
and various workflow solutions.

I also run KrellsKreations a 3D printing web store where I sell beautiful miniatures and terrain for DND and war gaming. 
I also sell pop culture statues and busts. These are all models sourced from various creators on Patreon and printed by myself.

Finally I run Krell Krypto LLC. For this I do live streams where I code, have crypto chats, game and do miniature painting. 
I also run an Ethereum validation node that provides API for IPFS, Ethereum 1.0/2.0, and other block chains
